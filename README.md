# ROS Reality

Hi! Welcome to ROS Reality, a package made by the [Humans to Robots Lab](http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown). This package connects a ROS network to a Unity scene over the internet, passing messages back and forth, as well as integrates virtual reality and augmented reality headsets for human robot interaction and teleoperation. You're currently looking at the second version of this package, which is built on top of the fantastic [ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp), made by Siemens.

# Installation 
1. Download and install Unity 2018.2
2. Install [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Some of the mesh files of baxter get pretty big, so LFS makes this much easier. 
3. Clone this repo
4. Open repo as new project
